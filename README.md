# Vision Based Cusrsor Control Using Hand Getures
Computer technology has become a necessary part of everyday life because of all the advancements that are being made just to improve the lifestyle and communication between Humans and computers. Special input and output devices have been designed over the years with the purpose of improving HCI. The basic accessory for HCI is mouse as most of the graphical user interfaces of diverse apps limit the input to mouse but mouse is not suitable for HCI in some real-life situations, For example Human Robot Interaction, 3d games, Navigating TV, Computer Simulation etc. There have been many researches that not just indicates the shortcomings of mouse but also address the best alternatives in detail. One of the best and intuitive approach is using hand gestures to control the movement of the cursor and to perform mouse operations.â€œVision Based Cursor Control Through hand gesturesâ€ is not an organization oriented project and the main purpose of this project is to help to all type of users including typical and expert users to perform different tasks using hand as its more natural way to interact with computer. Due to the nature of the project, it can be used in diverse applications as an increment. The proposed project has great significance in industry due to its possibility of usage in diverse type of applications and addressing more natural and optimized way to interact with computers. The aim of this project is to help typical users who would use the application for their personal use such as navigating the computer cursor and managing multiple windows efficiently and the expert users like Robotic engineers and Game developers who can also incorporate the application into their robot control application and game design respectively. Hand gesture recognition systems have many applications like Human Robot Interaction, 3d games, Navigating TV, Computer Simulation and above of these all the most important is for sign language recognition.
Virtual Mouse is a Desktop Application that shall enable the users to interact more naturally with their computers through hand gestures without using any additional harware or glove at all. It allow all users to perform following functions using hand gestures by utilizing the best out of webcam.


# Functionality
1) Control the movement of mouse 
2) Perform the mouse functions using hand gestures such as right click, left click from 13-15 inches distance 
3) No more delay then 0.1 sec. Concurrent execution 
4) Do not crash. System is robust enough to keep working in case of unknown gesture 
5) Multiple windows management 
6) User can interact more naturally 
7) Switch the control back to mouse anytime if needed 



# Instructions

Vision Based Virtual Mouse is a Desktop Application that shall enable the users to interact more naturally with their computers through hand gestures without using any additional harware or glove at all. It allow all users to perform mouse functions using hand gestures by utilizing the best out of webcam. 



# Set Up Enviornment
Well light room 
Test Webcam 
Install Emgucv 
Set up Enviornment Variables Properly 
Install Visual Studio 
Open the project and execute it or run just the exe file 


# Assumptions
It is assumed that the user has a computer with a working webcam. The program will not work without a working webcam. The application will automatically attempt to turn on the webcam and if this fails the user will be prompted to manually turn on the computers webcam. It is also assumed that the resolution of the webcam is at least 480 pixels. 
Software must be used in a well lit room. If the lighting condition is too poor, then the accuracy of the program sharply drops to a point where it is unusable. 
The application uses shape analysis to recognize the hand gesture, thus the users hand must be within 13-15 inhces distance from the webcam. 
The proposed system can only work with windows operating system. 
The proposed system uses a single webcam placed in front of the user so if any object in front of the hand or if there is any shadows forecasted on the hand then the system will not work. 
User hand shall not be rotated or tilted while performing hand gestures otherwise it will effect accuracy 


# Guidelines

After clicking on Cursor control button you 'll be able to perform following operations. 


Gesture 1:       Control the Movement of Mouse 
Gesture 2:       Left Mouse Click 
Gesture 3:       Right Mouse click 
Gesture 4:       Open Task manager 
Gesture 5:       Exit Application 
Gesture 6:       Scroll Down 
Gesture 7:       Scroll up 
Gesture 8:       Minimize current window 
Gesture 9:       Maximize the last minimized window 
Gesture 10:      Exit Application
